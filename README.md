# ShapeShifters UW-Madison CS766 Class Project

## Project Website
Please visit our [project website](https://kcmacauley.github.io/changeit3d/) for more information about the project and the experiments conducted. 

## Overview
This is the project repo of the ShapeShifters UW-Madison CS766 Class Project. This repo contains forked code from the original [changeit3d repo](https://github.com/optas/changeit3d) in addition to code developed specifically for this project. 

## Installation
Please flow the installation of the original [changeit3d repo](https://github.com/optas/changeit3d?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

**Note:** in order to use the python scripts used in generating the custom vase dataset you will need to install [open3d](https://www.open3d.org/).

Also, install the [pretrained weights](https://github.com/optas/changeit3d?tab=readme-ov-file#pretained-weights-and-networks).

**Note:** you may need to download the entire [dataset](https://github.com/optas/changeit3d?tab=readme-ov-file#shapetalk-dataset--rocket-).

## Run An Example

In order to reproduce results from the Part Removal experiment please run: 

[looking_inside_c3d_trained_system_seg.ipynb](https://github.com/kcmacauley/changeit3d/blob/main/changeit3d/notebooks/change_it_nets/looking_inside_c3d_trained_system_seg.ipynb)

To compare with the monolithic network results please run: 

[looking_inside_monolithic_trained_system_seg.ipynb](https://github.com/kcmacauley/changeit3d/blob/main/changeit3d/notebooks/change_it_nets/looking_inside_monolithic_trained_system_seg.ipynb)

**Note:** you will need to update paths from '/home/kcmacauley/ to where ever you installed the changeit3d repo.
